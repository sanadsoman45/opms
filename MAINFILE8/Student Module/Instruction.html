3.1 Problem Definition

3.3 Planning and Scheduling
3.4 Software and Hardware Requirements
3.5 Preliminary Product Description
3.6 Conceptual Models

&#x25CF; Problem Definition: Define the problem on which the students are working in the project. Provide details of the overall problem and then divide the problem in 
   to sub-problems. Define each sub-problem clearly.

&#x25CF; Requirements Specification: In this phase the student should define the requirements of the system, independent of how these requirements will be 
   accomplished. The Requirements Specification describes the things in the system and the actions that can be done on these things. Identify the operation and 
   problems of the existing system.

&#x25CF; Planning and Scheduling: Planning and scheduling is a complicated part of software development. Planning, for our purposes, can be thought of as determining 
   all the small tasks that must be carried out in order to accomplish the goal. Planning also takes into account, rules, known as constraints, which, control when 
   certain tasks can or cannot happen. Scheduling can be thought of as determining whether adequate resources are available to carry out the plan. The student 
   should show the Gantt chart and Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT).

&#x25CF; Software and Hardware Requirements: Define the details of all the software and hardware needed for the development and implementation of the project.
    &#9656; Hardware Requirement: In this section, the equipment, graphics card, numeric co-processor, mouse, disk capacity, RAM capacity etc. necessary to run the 
        software must be noted.

    &#9656; Software Requirements: In this section, the operating system, the compiler, testing tools, linker, and the libraries etc.  necessary to compile, link and install 
        the software must be listed.

&#x25CF; Preliminary Product Description: Identify the requirements and objectives of the new system. Define the functions and operation of the application/system the 
   students are developing as project.

&#x25CF; Conceptual Models: The student should understand the problem domain and produce a model of the system, which describes operations that can be performed 
   on the system, and the allowable sequences of those operations. Conceptual Models could consist of complete Data Flow Diagrams, ER diagrams, Object-oriented 
   diagrams, System Flowcharts etc.

4.4 User interface design
4.5 Security Issues
4.6 Test Cases Design

Describes desired features and operations in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode and other documentation.

&#x25CF; Basic Modules: The students should follow the divide and conquer theory, so divide the overall problem into more manageable parts and develop each part 
   or module separately. When all modules are ready, the student should integrate all the modules into one system. In this phase, the student should 
   briefly describe all the modules and the functionality of these modules.

&#x25CF; Data Design: Data design will consist of how data is organised, managed and manipulated.
    &#9656; Schema Design: Define the structure and explanation of schemas used in the project.

    &#9656; Data Integrity and Constraints: Define and explain all the validity checks and constraints provided to maintain data integrity.

&#x25CF; Procedural Design: Procedural design is a systematic way for developing algorithms or procedurals. 
    &#9656; Logic Diagrams: Define the systematical flow of procedure that improves its comprehension and helps the programmer during implementation. 
        e.g., Control Flow Chart, Process Diagrams etc.

    &#9656; Data Structures: Create and define the data structure used in procedures.

    &#9656; Algorithms Design: With proper explanations of input data, output data, logic of processes, design and explain the working of algorithms.

&#x25CF; User Interface Design: Define user, task, environment analysis and how to map those requirements in order to develop a "User Interface". Describe the 
   external and internal components and the architecture of user interface. Show some rough pictorial views of the user interface and its components.

&#x25CF; Security Issues: Discuss Real-time considerations and Security issues related to the project and explain how the student intends avoiding those security 
   problems. What are the security policy plans and architecture?

&#x25CF; Test Cases Design: Define test cases, which will provide easy detection of errors and mistakes with in a minimum period of time and with the least effort. 
   Explain the different conditions in which the students wish to ensure the correct working of theproject.

      5.3.2 Integrated Testing
      5.3.3 Beta Testing
5.4 Modifications and Improvements
5.5 Test Cases

&#x25CF; Implementation Approaches: Define the plan of implementation, and the standards the students have used in the implementation.

&#x25CF; Coding Details and Code Efficiency: Students not need include full source code, instead, include only the important codes (algorithms, applets code, forms 
   code etc). The program code should contain comments needed for explaining the work a piece of code does. Comments may be needed to explain why it 
   does it, or, why it does a particular way. The student can explain the function of the code with a shot of the output screen of that program code.
    &#9656; Code Efficiency: The student should explain how the code is efficient and how the students have handled code optimisation.

&#x25CF; Testing Approach: Testing should be according to the scheme presented in the system design chapter and should follow some suitable model – e.g., category 
   partition, state machine-based. Both functional testing and user-acceptance testing are appropriate. Explain the approach of testing.
    &#9656; Unit Testing: Unit testing deals with testing a unit or module as a whole. This would test the interaction of many functions but, do confine the test within one 
        module.

    &#9656; Integrated Testing: Brings all the modules together into a special testing environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability. It deals with tests for 
        the entire application. Application limits and features are tested here.

    &#9656; Beta Testing is performed by real users of the software application in a real environment. Beta testing is one of the type of User Acceptance Testing.

&#x25CF; Modifications and Improvements: Once the students finish the testing they are bound to be faced with bugs, errors and they will need to modify your source 
   code to improve the system. Define what modification are implemented in the system and how it improved the system.

6.1 Test Reports
6.2 User Documentation

&#x25CF; Test Reports: Explain the test results and reports based on the test cases, which should show that theproject is capable of facing any problematic situation 
   and that it works fine in different conditions. Take the different sample inputs and show the outputs.

&#x25CF; User Documentation: Define the working of the software; explain its different functions, components with screen shots. The user document should provide 
   all the details of the product in such a way that any user reading the manual, is able to understand the working and functionality of the document.

&#x25CF; Conclusion: The conclusions can be summarised in a fairly short chapter (2 or 3 pages). This chapter brings together many of the points that would have 
   made in the other chapters.

&#x25CF; Limitations of the System: Explain the limitations encountered during the testing of the project that the students were not able to modify. List the criticisms 
   accepted during the demonstrations of the project. 

&#x25CF; Future Scope of the Project describes two things: firstly, new areas of investigation prompted by developments in this project, and secondly, parts of the 
   current work that was not completed due to time constraints and/or problems encountered.
